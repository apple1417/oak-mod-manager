    Opens a file in a mod folder for reading, handling possibly being inside a .sdkmod.

    Transforms the `KeyError` from a file not existing in a zip into a `FileNotFoundError` - so you
    only need to catch a single exception.

    Args:
        path: The path to open. This should generally be constructed relative to `__file__`.
        binary: True if to open in binary mode.
    Returns:
        An open file object.
